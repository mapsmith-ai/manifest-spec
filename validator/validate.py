"""Standalone validator for provenance manifests (spec v1). Stdlib only.

This is a second, independent implementation of the contract: the JSON Schema
in ``schema/`` is the normative one, and this file re-states it in plain Python
so that checking a manifest needs no toolchain at all. The two are kept in
agreement by the conformance suite — a fixture that one accepts and the other
rejects is a bug in one of them, and the suite says which.

Usage:
    python validate.py manifest.json [more.json ...]

Exit 0 when every file conforms; 1 otherwise, with one reason per line. As a
library: ``problems(record) -> list[str]`` (empty means conforming).
